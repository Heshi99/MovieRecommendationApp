#🎬 Movie Recommendation Web App

##Overview
This is a modern Movie Recommendation Web App that allows users to search for any movie they like. The app dynamically fetches movie data from the TMDb (The Movie Database) API to provide real-time updates on trending movies, search results, and personalized recommendations.

##Key Features
✅ Movie Search – Users can search for any movie by title and get instant results with details like posters, descriptions, and ratings.
✅ Trending Movies – The app displays a list of the most popular and trending movies.
✅ User-Based Recommendations – Personalized movie recommendations based on search history. The app tracks the number of times a user searches for a movie and uses this data to suggest relevant films.
✅ Fast & Lightweight – Built with React + Vite, ensuring smooth performance and fast load times.
✅ Responsive UI – Designed with CSS to provide a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

##Tech Stack

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
